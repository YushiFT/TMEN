# TMEN
## About
R source code for constructing Tripartite Microbial-Environment Network (TMEN) and conducting related statistical analysis

## Note
We are currently wrapping up all calculation details into a complete R package. Will also incoporate more discussions about reliable estimates of the microbe-metabolism correlation.
